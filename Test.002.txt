Unreasonable points:
- Label of dropdown in "Printer" section is "Name"
 -> It should be "Type" and Name must be in the "Type" position in the section
- Radio button in "Print Range" section: All and Current page are selected
 -> Do not select two values at the same time in a radio button group.
- In Print Handling section has a check box(near check box "Auto-Rotate" v√† "Auto-Center") was selected, but it does not have label to indidate what value
In my opinion, when that checkbox is checked, both checkboxes Auto-Rotate and Auto-Center are checked. If unchecked, both are unchecked. If only one of Auto-Rotate or Auto-Center  is checked, then that checkbox will be unchecked.
